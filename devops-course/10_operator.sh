# !
# -n STRING: the lenght of string > 0
# -z string: the len of str in empty or 0
# STRING1 = STRING2: STRING1 is = STRING2
# STRING1 != STRING2: STRING1 is not = STRING2
# INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2: INTEGER1 is numerically = INTEGER2
# INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2: INTEGER1 is numerically > INTEGER2
# INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2: INTEGER1 is numerically < INTEGER2
# -d FILE: FILE exits and is a directory
# -e FILE: FILE exits
# -r FILE: FILE exists and the read permision is granted
# s FILE: FILE exists and its size is > 0 (not empty)
# -w FILE: FILE exists and the write permission is granted
# -x FILE: FILE exits and the execute permission is granted
